1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?

I learned and practiced how to build and use a node program from sketch.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

No logic problem struggle most. But how to factor out the condition check spend me lots of 
time. I solved this by try every idea I poped up and checked whether it is correct.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

There are some key idea I learned last week in class that be reviewed in the assignment, 
such as creating nodes and revising nodes in recursion. The process of working this 
assignment would help me using these skills to solve the programs with similar content.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

No. It is clear.

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)

3h on coding
1h on debugging
